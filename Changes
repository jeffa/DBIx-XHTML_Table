1.36

1.34

1.32
	- forced lc end tag
	- more minor doc changes

1.30
	- minor doc changes

1.28
	- finally 'blessed' add_cols and drop_calls
	  (no longer undocumented)

1.26
	- changed the blessed ref regex to simply /DBI/
	  (forgot about Apache::DBI ... doh!)

1.24
	- finally realized that w3c requires tfoot to come before
	  tbody ... fixed
	- added DBIx::Password compatibility, any blessed ref
	  passed to constructor that matches /^DBIx?::/ will work

1.22
	- well, extremely's patch turned 0's into &nbsp; - fixed
	  (you rule anyway Mark!)
	- also, now escaping ampersands in _build_body_row
	  (this prolly should be a user option ...)

1.20
	- added extremely's patch to keep NULL warnings at bay

1.18
	- forgot to name directory correctly in last version

1.16
	- incremented copyright date

1.14
	- finally fixed 1..1 in test.pl ... sillly /me

1.12
	- fixed bugs in _build_body_row(): 0's were being replaced
          with &nbsp; tags (thanks LTJake!)

1.10
	- fixed two bugs in set_col_colors - first, modify would
	  over write it; second - 4 colors, 6 columns did not work
	- attributes are now inheritable

1.01    - fixed bug within _refinate() - introduced from
	  cols by number feature 

1.00    - added support for specifying columns by number
	- fixed map_cell bug - second call would wipe out first
	- experimenting with tests ... :/

0.99
	- deprecated modify_tag() for modify() - same results
	- deprecated no_whitespace output() attrib for no_indent
	- set_row_colors() now only works for entire rows
	  added set_col_colors() to handle columns, also
	  refactored both subs to use modify_tag() instead
	- bug fix: default ucfirst on headers overrode map_head()
	- bug fix: modify_tag() on 'td' with 'body' works now
	- added MIT license

0.98
	- set_row_colors() now uses style, can use old bgcolor
	- all methods that normally returned void now return $self
	  (this allows stacking methods)
	- changed output() arguments to a hash ref
	- modify_tag() now recognizes 'style' attribute values as
	  hash references themselves

0.97
	- deprecated get_table() for output() - same results
	- added automatic header ucfirst and 'no_ucfirst' to turn off
	- removed tutorial from POD
	- added link to homepage to POD and corrected typos

0.96
	- deprecated map_col() for map_cell() - same results
	  just hopefully a more descriptive name
	- added get_current_row() and get_current_col()
	- added set_pk(), this and the last 2 subs were
	  inspired by Jim Cromie to finagle XHTML_Table into
	  a 'spreadsheet' - see the POD for set_pk()

0.95
	- added map_head()
	- changed default behavior of not specifying cols
	  in methods such as map_col and calc_totals
	  new behavior: no cols = all cols
	- constructor now accepts a hash ref as last arg
	  which allows minor table config to be specified
	  without multiple modify_tag() calls
	- modified behavior of map_col() and map_head()
	  they no longer permantly change the data, all
	  processing is done when creating table output

0.90
	- MAJOR: Changed HEADER to HEAD and FOOTER to FOOT
	- Apparrently all past versions have a syntax error
	  occur when modify_tag() is called on <colgroup>
	  BEFORE add_col_tag() is called - fixed.
	- modifying <tr> affects all areas now, not just BODY
	  this probably makes set_row_colors() obsolete, except
	  when subtotals are present.
	- more minor output formatting fixed - should be perfect!
0.86 
	- fixed minor output fomatting - <thead> was on same 
	  line as <table>, and <tbody> would do the same if
	  headers were supressed

0.85  Sat May 12 14:38:02 CDT 2001
	- found major bug in _build_body() - a <tbody>
	  tag pair was being created for every row if a
	  group was not set (.. is not the same as ,)

0.84  Sat May 12 02:51:58 CDT 2001
	- MAJOR: changed add_colgroup() to add_col_tag()
	  the former name was ambigious (col or colgroup?)
	- implemented new calc_totals(), calc_subtotals(),
	  set_group(), _build_body(), _build_body_row(),
	  and added _build_body_group() to handle producing
	  the proper <tbody> tag pairs, as well as simplifying
	  the complexity of calculating totals
	- added a tag reference table to documentation

0.83  Thu May 10 17:09:16 CDT 2001
	- added Mark's patch to produce </tbody> tag
	- patch also lower cased all tags
	- documentation typo fixes

0.82  Tue May  8 09:14:54 CDT 2001
	- corrected incorrect version number
	- corrected formatting in credits

0.81  Mon May  7 22:34:16 CDT 2001
	- made the package name fully qualified
	- updated and corrected documentation
